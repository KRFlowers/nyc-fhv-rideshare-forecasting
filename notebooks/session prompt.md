I'm working on a NYC rideshare demand forecasting notebook (Jupyter notebook, part of a 4-notebook pipeline). In a previous session, we reviewed and edited the entire notebook to make it professional, scannable for recruiters, and clear for data scientists.

Context from previous session:
- Notebook: 03_demand_forecasting2.ipynb (forecasting pipeline notebook)
- Goal: Predict daily zone-level rideshare demand using Seasonal Naive baseline, Prophet, and XGBoost models
- We edited: intro sections, model rationale, subsection headers, interpretations, assert statements, and export sections
- Key changes: Removed "100 zones" references (changed to "all zones") because I updated my EDA to include all zones instead of top 100
- Fixed hard-coded assert in Cell 94 to be dynamic
- Added consistent subsection context headers throughout
- Clarified comments (e.g., assert statements, temporal splitting)

I've now rerun the notebook with the updated dataset (all zones instead of top 100). [DESCRIBE YOUR QUESTION OR ISSUE HERE]

Can you help me review/edit/troubleshoot?
